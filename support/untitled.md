## Extra Horizon deployment <a id="Extra-Horizon-deployment"></a>

For each customer, a dedicated account is created per type of deployment \(Dev/Staging/Production\). Within this account, there can be different Virtual Private Clusters deployed \(depending on multi-region requirements\). Within these VPC’s, the Extra Horizon clusters are set up. This ensures that infrastructure is isolated for each customer, and data resides within the customer’s environment.
