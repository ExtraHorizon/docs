[ExtraHorizon](https://www.extrahorizon.com/medical-cloud-backend) is a medical Backend As A Service product that leverages existing cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure to deliver an easy and fast roadmap towards fully certified and compliant cloud connected medical devices. Currently, Extra Horizon compatibility is optimised with AWS. Future clouds are on the roadmap.

ExtraHorizon exists of a set of web services that the customer can use to compose a custom backend specific to their needs.

## A dedicated backend for your medical application

Every ExtraHorizon environment is deployed on dedicated cloud resources. There is **no infrastructure sharing between customers!** Each cluster has an ExtraHorizon infrastructure layer on which additional services can be deployed. You can access your deployment through a tailored API. Each of these modules are built according to IEC62304 standards and meet regulatory compliance.

## Services

### Identity & Access Management

#### User Service 

The user service manages identities in an ExtraHorizon Cluster. Each action you take always occurs in the context of such an identity.

Use this service to register new identities, manage user roles, user permissions, password management and more.

#### Authentication Service

The authentication service is responsible to authenticate each incoming request and attach an identity to that request.

The service supports multiple authentication mechanisms such as oAuth1.0, oAuth2.0, SSO, MFA,…

### Storage

#### Document Service 

The document service provides storage and query capabilities.

This service allows you to: 

* define you own queryable data models by utilising JSON schema’s
* define workflows that can trigger other services or automation rules in the network

The data service, like all other services, support an extremely flexible querying language in the form of querying parameters.
