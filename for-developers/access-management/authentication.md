# Auth Service

## oAuth2

oAuth2.0 standard: [\[rfc6749\]](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)

### Making an authenticated request

An example request to the User Service which is authenticated by OAuth2 looks like this:

```
GET users/v1/me HTTP/1.1
Host: api.<environment>.<â€‹company>.extrahorizon.io
Authorization: Bearer 93a4d85654c24bd5a59c9b41f94f49e7
```

The role of the `Bearer` prefix in the **Authorization header** specifies that a token value is expected, implying a token-based authentication. In the case of OAuth2, this token value is the Access Token.

**Using the Extra Horizon SDK**

The Extra Horizon sdk solves the problem of making authenticated requests for you and will attach the right headers to the calls you are making in the background.

### Password Grant

The Password Grant accepts your username and password, then returns an Access Token and a Refresh token. As mentioned before the Access Token can be used to authenticate API requests. These Access Tokens are short lived (A lifetime of 5 minutes for the flow described in the example below).

```javascript
await sdk.auth.authenticate({
    username:'john.doe@example.com'
    password:'myPassword1234'
});
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Not that in case this user has MFA enable this function will throw a `MfaRequiredError`. With the information in the error you can follow the [Mfa Grant](authentication.md#mfa-grant) to complete the authentication.
{% endhint %}

### Mfa Grant

When MFA is enabled for a user and you try to authenticate using the password grant you will receive a `MfaRequiredError` . You can catch the error and use the Mfa Grant to complete the authentication.

```javascript
try {
  await sdk.auth.authenticate({
    password: '',
    username: '',
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof MfaRequiredError) {
    const { mfa } = error.response;

    // Your logic to request which method the user want to use in case of multiple methods
    const methodId = mfa.methods[0].id;

    await sdk.auth.confirmMfa({
      token: mfa.token,
      methodId,
      code: '', // code from ie. Google Authenticator
    });
  }
  // handle other possible authentication errors
}
```

### Authorization Grant

In most cases you will want to use to authorization Grant flow for external applications that are not under your direct control. E.g. partners that you allow to have an integration with your platform.

You don't want them to handle your users credentials and will require these applications to obtain an authorization grant code by redirecting you a /authorize endpoint hosted by one of your trusted applications.

An example of such a webpage would look like this:&#x20;

```
/authorize/?client_id={CLIENT_ID}&response_type=code&redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}
```

When the user is authenticated on that page he/she will be redirected back to the URI specified in the client registration and the query parameter. this redirect will contain an authorization code that you can then use in the SDK to obtain an authentication.

```javascript
await sdk.auth.authenticate({
  code: '{yourAuthorizionCodeHere}',
});
```

### Refresh Token Grant

The Refresh Token Grant is a mechanism to obtain a new Access Token. The grant accepts a Refresh Token and returns a new Access Token and a new Refresh Token. That way, the application keeps a valid access token without having the user to provide its credentials again.

When an access token is expired the SDK will use the refresh token stored in memory to refresh the tokens and make sure your call to the api is tried again.

When you want your user to stay authenticated when he reopens you app you will need to store the refreshToken and initiate the SDK authentication with the stored token.

```javascript
await sdk.auth.authenticate({
  refreshToken: 'myRefreshToken',
});
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note that the refresh token changes every time a new access token is obtained. Therefore you will need to add a listener to the SDK to be notified when a new refresh token is received and for your app to safely and securely store it.
{% endhint %}

Each time the SDK refreshes the `accessToken` the `freshTokensCallback` is called with the response. You can store this data in `localStorage` or any other persistant data store. When you restart your application, you can check the data store for a `refreshToken` and use that to authenticate with the SDK.

```javascript
const sdk = createOAuth2Client({
  host: '',
  clientId: '',
  freshTokensCallback: tokenData => {
    localStorage.setItem('tokenData', tokenData);
  },
});
```

### Retrieve a list of active tokens

You can retrieve a list of active tokens and the applications they correspond to.

```javascript
await sdk.auth.oauth2.getAuthorizations({
    rql: //optional rql query
});
```

### Revoking tokens

You can revoke tokens by use the deleteAuthorization function.

```javascript
await sdk.auth.oauth2.deleteAuthorization('');
```

## oAuth1

### Password grant

This grant for the sdk works the same way as for oauth2. [read more](authentication.md#password-grant)

### Mfa Grant

This grant for the sdk works the same way as for oauth2. [read more](authentication.md#mfa-grant)

### Retrieve a list of active tokens

TODO, not yet supported by SDK

### Revoking tokens

TODO, not yet supported by SDK

### Generate SSO Tokens

Using the SDK you can create a single use SSO token. Another client can consume such a token and exchange it for an authorization.

```
TODO
```

### Consume SSO Tokens

SSO tokens can only be consumed by oAuth1 applications.

```
TODO
```

### Other settings

#### Token authentication with optional skip

The `skipTokenCheck` saves \~300ms by skipping validation on your `token` and `tokenSecret`.

```javascript
import { createOAuth1Client } from '@extrahorion/javascript-sdk';

const sdk = createOAuth1Client({
  host: 'dev.fibricheck.com',
  consumerKey: '',
  consumerSecret: '',
});

await sdk.auth.authenticate({
  token: '',
  tokenSecret: '',
  skipTokenCheck: true,
});
```

## MFA

Extrahorizon supports multiple multifactor authentication methods. To obtain ExH access tokens you will always need the users credentials. Depending on the MFA settings of the user you will either receive the tokens or be prompted with an error requiring you to use a MFA method.

Currently Extra Horizon supports two MFA methods: **Recovery codes** and **Google Authenticator**.

The Extra Horizon SDK has not yet implemented these endpoints. You can use them by connecting directly with our REST Api's: [MFA endpoints](https://developers.extrahorizon.io/swagger-ui/?url=https://developers.extrahorizon.io/services/auth-service/2.0.4-dev/openapi.yaml#/MFA)
