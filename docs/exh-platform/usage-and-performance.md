You as an applications builder needs to be aware of the performance impact and user experience in the  applications you are building. Theoretically the file service can handle files up to 5 TB. However, uploading large files can take a long time and when internet connections fail it can result in a bad user experience. Therefore when you are expecting your application to process large files, please have a talk with our Solution Architecture Team, we are here to help.&#x20;
