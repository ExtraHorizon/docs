# ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· HDS/HDH Certification

The **HDS (HÃ©bergeur de DonnÃ©es de SantÃ©)** certification is a legal requirement in France for any organization that **hosts, processes, or stores personal health data** on behalf of third parties, such as healthcare providers or patients. Established under Articles **L.1111-8** and **R.1111-9** of the **French Public Health Code**, this certification ensures the **security, confidentiality, and integrity** of sensitive health data.

The certification is issued by an accredited body under the supervision of the **Agence du NumÃ©rique en SantÃ© (ANS)** and follows strict guidelines aligned with **GDPR** and national regulations.

HDS certification is **mandatory** for all cloud providers and IT services managing health data in France and is essential to operate legally in the French healthcare sector.
