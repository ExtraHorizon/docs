### Rationale for Selecting OTS Software

_<mark style="color:blue;">Why is this OTS software appropriate for this medical device?</mark>_

### Expected Limitations

_<mark style="color:blue;">What are the expected design limitations of the OTS software?</mark>_

## Computer System Specifications

### Hardware Specifications

_<mark style="color:blue;">Processor (manufacturer, speed, and features), RAM (memory size), hard disk size, other storage, communications, display, etc.</mark>_

### Software Specifications

_<mark style="color:blue;">Operating system, drivers, utilities, etc. The software requirements specification (SRS) listing for each item should contain the name (such as Microsoft Windows Operating System, Microsoft Windows Drivers, etc.), specific version levels (such as 4.1, 5.0, etc.) and a complete list of any patches that have been provided by the OTS software manufacturer.</mark>_

## Ensuring End User Compliance and Correct Use

_<mark style="color:blue;">How will you assure appropriate actions are taken by the End User?</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">The following should be specified:</mark>_

* _<mark style="color:blue;">What aspects of the OTS software and system can (and/or must) be installed/configured?</mark>_
* _<mark style="color:blue;">What steps are permitted (or must be taken) to install and/or configure the product?</mark>_
* _<mark style="color:blue;">How often will the configuration need to be changed? · What education and training are suggested or required for the user of the OTS software? · What measures have been designed into the medical device to prevent the operation of any non-specified OTS software (e.g., word processors, games)? Operation of non-specified OTS software may be prevented by system design, preventive measures, or labeling. Introduction may be prevented by disabling input (USB, CD, modems).</mark>_

## Functionality of the OTS Software

_<mark style="color:blue;">What does the OTS do?</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">What function does the OTS Software provide in this device? The following should be specified:</mark>_

* _<mark style="color:blue;">What is the OTS software intended to do? The sponsor’s design documentation should specify exactly which OTS components will be included in the design of the medical device and to what extent OTS software is involved in error control and messaging in device error control.</mark>_
* _<mark style="color:blue;">What are the links with other software including software outside the medical device (not reviewed as part of this or another application)? The links to outside software should be completely defined for each medical device/module. The design documentation should include a complete description of the linkage between the medical device software and any outside software (e.g., networks).</mark>_

## Verification & Validation

_<mark style="color:blue;">How do you know it works?</mark>_

* <mark style="color:blue;">Based on documentation Level (i.e., Basic or Enhanced) determined for the device software as discussed in the guidance titled “Content of Premarket Submissions for Device Software Functions,” sponsors should: Describe testing, verification, and validation of the OTS Software and ensure it is appropriate for the device hazards 8 13 See footnote 5.Contains Nonbinding Recommendations associated with the OTS Software.</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Provide the results of the testing. · Is there a current list of OTS Software problems (bugs) and access to updates?</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">For more information on software testing, verification, and validation, please see section III.C.</mark>

## Lifecycle Management and Control of OTS Components

_<mark style="color:blue;">How will you keep track of (control) the OTS Software?</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">An appropriate plan should answer the following questions:</mark>

* <mark style="color:blue;">What measures have been designed into the medical device to prevent the introduction of incorrect versions? On startup, ideally, the medical device should check to verify that all software is the correct title, version level, and configuration. If the correct software is not loaded, the medical device should warn the operator and shut down to a safe state.</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">How will you maintain the OTS software configuration?</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Where and how will you store the OTS software?</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">How will you ensure proper installation of the OTS software?</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">How will you ensure proper maintenance and life cycle support for the OTS software?</mark>
