# Auth Service

The Auth Service provides support for multiple authentication methods and protocols to your cluster.

The protocols Extra Horizon provides for authentication are **OAuth 1** and **OAuth 2**. Next to those, **Multi-Factor Authentication** (MFA) and **OpenID Connect** add an extra layer of security and flexibility to your users authentication process.&#x20;
