# Notification Service

The Notification Service is used to compose and store short, generic messages for the end user of an application and, optionally, to send these messages as push notifications to the user’s mobile device. The customer’s application can retrieve a user’s messages to display them in its UI and can subsequently mark them as viewed.

Certain common actions within the User and Data Services are by default set up to trigger the creation of basic notifications. In addition, the customer’s application can request the creation of more specialized messages.
