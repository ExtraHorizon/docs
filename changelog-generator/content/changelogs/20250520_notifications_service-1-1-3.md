**‚öíÔ∏è Improvements**

- **Retries for additional Firebase error types**
  - We now automatically retry additional error types that Firebase may respond with when sending a notification to a user's device.
- **RQL improvement**
  - Requesting a limit greater than the maximum now sets the maximum
- **Improved support for future database security mechanisms**


**üêû Bugs Fixed**

- Querying on field names ending with `_id` in the `fields` object is fixed
- Now correctly erroring when no RQL is supplied while deleting notifications
