**⚒️ Improvements**

- **Increased the stability of the service**  
  Service discovery is now based on DNS and more reliable.
- **Internationalized email address support**  
  Email addresses using non ascii characters, such as `二ノ宮@黒川.日本`, are now supported via updating our validation to be based on [RFC 6530](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6530).


**🐞 Bugs Fixed**

- Inconsistencies in querying on certain fields (`template_id`, `updateTimestamp`, …) with RQL have been resolved.
