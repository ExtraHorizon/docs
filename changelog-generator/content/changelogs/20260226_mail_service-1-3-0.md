**🎁 Features**

- **Added support for the template service V2**  
  Emails can now be sent using templates from Template Service V2. The Template Service automatically resolves either to a V1 template of V2 template.

- **Send emails by template name rather than id**  
  The POST / endpoint now also accepts a template_name property to target a V2 template by name rather than having to supply templates by their id.
