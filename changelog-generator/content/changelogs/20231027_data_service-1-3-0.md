**🎁 Features**
* Added a skipCount() RQL function that instructs the listing function not to execute and return the total count.


**🐞 Bugs Fixed**
* Known `SERVICE_EXCEPTION`s thrown on RQL errors are now resolved to `INVALID_RQL_EXCEPTION`s
* The `<` and `>` characters may now be used in RQL when [double encoded](https://docs.extrahorizon.com/extrahorizon/additional-resources/resource-query-language-rql#double-encoding-of-special-characters).
