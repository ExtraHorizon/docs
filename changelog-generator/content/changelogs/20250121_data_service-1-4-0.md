**üéÅ Features**

- **The Schema access control options are now more granular**
  - Schema `createMode`, `readMode`, `updateMode` and `deleteMode` have been improved to be more consistent and accept multiple granular options.
  - For further information please refer to the data access management documentation. 


- **Executing a Transition by name**
  - When executing a Transition, instead of having to find and provide the `id`, you can now choose to provide the `name` of a Transition. This improvement will make code clearer and easier to re-use across your different clusters.


- **New Transition permissions**  
  The following permissions have been added to allow the execution of Transitions:

  - Execute any Transition in any Schema:  
    `TRANSITION_DOCUMENTS`

  - Execute any Transition in a specific Schema:  
    `TRANSITION_DOCUMENTS:{SCHEMA_NAME}`

  - Execute a specific Transition for a specific Schema:  
  `TRANSITION_DOCUMENTS:{SCHEMA_NAME}:{TRANSITION_NAME}`


- **Group permissions**
  - Staff members can now be assigned permission to perform operations on a Document that is linked to their Groups. The permissions `VIEW_DOCUMENTS`, `UPDATE_DOCUMENTS`, `DELETE_DOCUMENTS` and `TRANSITION_DOCUMENTS` are now supported. (Including their sub-permissions e.g. `VIEW_DOCUMENTS:{SCHEMA_NAME}`)



- **Task Action quality of life improvements**
  - The Task Action now supports the `priority` field
  - The Task Action is now supported for Transition `afterActions`.


**üö® Deprecation Warnings**

- **Legacy schema access control options**
  - Most of the existing createMode, readMode, updateMode and deleteMode values have been deprecated in favor of the revamped access control options.
