# Subscriptions

Subscription objects are uniquely identified by their `id`. They contain the “contact details” of the subscribing service and a list of event\_types of which the service wishes to receive Events.

The (Extra Horizon) services are uniquely identified by (and can be contacted via) their name (a URL) and version. The version consists of three numbers as defined by the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) specifications: major, minor, and patch.
